        <h2>1. A tree with roots</h2>
        <p>
          This one looks like one of the cheesy stock images you'll see when
          searching for images about growing a business. Only the AI has made it
          more raw with the roots growing into the person's hand.<br><br><span>This image is made with Dall-E 2</span>

        <h2 class="text">2. A tasty treat</h2>
        <p>
          You could assume that Dall-e 2 had an easy task here. It's likely the AI had a lot of cookie photos to learn from. But it's still incredible to think that this was created just from a request and not from a single photo snapped by a photographer. <br><br><span>This image is made with Dall-E 2</span>

        <h2>3. A monster bowl of soup</h2>
        <p>
          One of the less delicious food images that Dall-e 2 has created. This one shows "a bowl of soup that looks like a monster, knitted out of wool".  We were told never to play with our food but this food looks like it would play with you.  <br><br><span>This image is made with Dall-E 2</span>

        <h2>4. Digital creatures</h2>
        <p>
          Dall-e 2 is capable of creating all sorts of impressive images. Including astounding digital artwork of curious creatures. <br><br>“A butterfly perched on the snout of a sleeping dragon, digital art”  <br><br><span>This image is made with Dall-E 2</span>

        <h2>5. A muddy dog</h2>
        <p>
          With all the photos that everyone posts online of their dogs it's no wonder that AI can create realistic images like this when asked to. <br><br><span>This image is made with Dall-E 2</span>
